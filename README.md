## Project Description
This is Android App that will help students to request lab parts anytime and anywhere. This app will save time for both students and staff members.<br/>
All they need to do are: <br/>
• Log in to the app by student number and password <br/>
• Choose parts in the catalogue <br/>
• Make a request <br/>
• Confirm that they returned the requested items
This app includes 4 pages/tabs (Login, Catalog (Items), Request(Selected), Return Items (Requested)). The data submitted through the app updates the count of available items in the database. <br/>
After completing logging in process users will be able to browse parts and request them.<br/>
