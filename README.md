##Project Description
This is Android App that will help students to request lab parts anytime and anywhere. This app will save time for both students and staff members. 
All they need to do are: 
• Log in to the app by entering name, student number
• Choose parts in the catalogue 
• Make a request 
This app includes 3 pages (Login, Catalog, Checkout). By applying these features to our project we will be able to 
get important information and add it to database which can be used by staff members. 
After completing logging in process users will be able to browse parts and submit them.
